## Description

The theme of this Tp will be free, they will have to consume some API to provide content to their application, there are many free of all kinds. A favorites section should be created, where the user can store information about that API. They will have to use Firestore to manage the database in this section and will use FireAuth for user authentication. They will also have to use a minimum of 2 custom hooks.

The test will not be mandatory, but will give extra points if they do it.
